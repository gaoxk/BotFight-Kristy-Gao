# BotFight-Kristy-Gao
Hi! This is the Simultions Challenge for Kristy Gao, Winter 2018 application.
## Why this weird method of submission?
I'm most comfortable with java, and began working. I realized that I had no way to turn my code into a command line executable program! I tried looking at potential solutions, but it looked like a technical mess and I was *very* tight on time due to a number of unlucky circumstances. I knew exactly how I wanted to program this and didn't want to be hindered by technical issues. My next most comfortable language was javascript, and I was already comfortable making applications with js.

## So what did I accomplish?
I got levels 1 and 2 done! Everything prints out to the console and input comes in the form of promts. Js promts are awkward and I would've liked to use something like promise-alert had I the time to learn it.

## Missed Goals
I really wanted to get a prettier GUI going on with actual graphics. It would've only been a matter of a few more lines of code and properly sized images; nothing a half hour of work can't accomplish.  

Bonus? Oh boy, I don't have much experience with back end, let alone making a networking multiplayer game. I don't think I could've achieved the bonus in 24 hours, but I you've given me another entry on my to do list of stuff I want to learn.
